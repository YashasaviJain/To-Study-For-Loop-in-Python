# * Aim
To Study For Loop in Python and understand its working through different examples like number printing, sum of N numbers, matrix operations, patterns and combinations.

---

# * Theory

The for loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.  
It is mainly used when we know how many times we want to repeat the statement.

A for loop works with sequences like:
* List  
* Tuple  
* String  
* Range  

### Syntax of For Loop

```python
for variable in sequence:
    statement(s)
```

The loop runs until all items in the sequence are completed.

# * Algorithm

## 1. Print Numbers from 1 to 5
1. Start  
2. Use a for loop from 1 to 5  
3. Display each number  
4. Stop  

## 2. Sum of First N Numbers
1. Start  
2. Take input from user  
3. Initialize total as 0  
4. Run loop from 1 to n  
5. Add each number to total  
6. Display the sum  
7. Stop  

## 3. 3×3 Matrix Display
1. Start  
2. Store matrix values  
3. Use nested loops  
4. Print elements row by row  
5. Stop  

## 4. Multiplication of Two 3×3 Matrices
1. Start  
2. Initialize two matrices  
3. Create result matrix with zero values  
4. Use three nested loops  
5. Multiply and add elements  
6. Display result matrix  
7. Stop  

## 5. Print All Possible Combinations of Three Digits
1. Start  
2. Store three digits  
3. Use three nested loops  
4. Check digits are not repeated  
5. Print all valid combinations  
6. Stop  

## 6. Right Angle Triangle Pattern
1. Start  
2. Use loop in reverse order  
3. Print stars in each row  
4. Stop  

## 7. Pyramid Pattern
1. Start  
2. Set number of rows  
3. Use loop to print spaces and stars  
4. Stop

# * Conclusion

In this experiment, we studied the for loop in Python.

We learned:
* Printing numbers using loop  
* Calculating sum of N numbers  
* Using nested loops  
* Matrix display and multiplication  
* Pattern printing  
* Generating combinations  

The for loop is very useful for repeating tasks and working with sequences in Python.
